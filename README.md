## 3. Use the latest version of Bootstrap or other CSS Framework of your choice (Tailwind, Bulma, Material Design…)

### In this project i decided to use tailwind cause of the freedom that it offers when it comes to customizing the website

### Its been a little harder for me learning how to use it but i really like how it works

### Iv added a few clases and plugins due to the amount of animations / break points

## 4 Use at least 5 of the following Bootstrap Components (if you’re not using Bootstrap, implement the component using your CSS Framework)

### As iv been using tailwind to develop the website, i dont have any of this components so iv created them, theres a punch of them implemented but ill mention just a few

  1. Install sass dependency

## 6 Use Bootstrap Utilities for margins, paddings, alignments, shadows... List in the Documentation the Bootstrap utilities that you have used

### All of this features have been implemented with tailwind

## 7 Take advantage of Bootstrap to make the interface responsive, adaptive and fluid

### As iv mentioned previously iv been using tailwind so I had to build from 0 all the responsive interface by defining the break points at tailwind.config.js

## 8 Regarding the web images

### In this website iv optimaze a punch of images but for me the best ones are the svg images Which have their own custom path!

## 9 In the CAROUSEL/SLIDER, use at least 3 images with the appropriate size/quality ratio

### As you could see on the previously carousel image, all the image sizes and ratios are appropiated

## 10 Create a color palette and apply it to the project.

### Color palette

## 11 The UI and UX criteria seen in class are generally followed

### This website follows good practices that improve UI and UX.
#### 1 - Accesibility
#### 2 - Color palette
#### 3 - Preformance
#### 4 - Distintive 
#### 5 - Content distribution


## 12 Lighthouse

### As you can see in the next image, my website is almost fully optimaze, that also means that all the structure and files (including the size) are correct

# EXTENSION

## 1 Create more pages than are strictly required

### Implemented 8 diferent pages or "views"

## 2 Use an image API in your project 

### I havent implemented an image api cause instead iv developed a method to transfrom an image to base64 and then store it at the db to extract the image when its necessary

## 3 Use Vue 3 to manage a dynamic array of products or items instead of using static contents

### Here theres a clear example where im using it

# CONCLUSION

## In this project iv learned the basics about view (routes,views,modules ...) and as i have previously documented, my project follows all the steps required
